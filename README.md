My solution for the reactjs tic-tac-toe tutorial with the bonus content. Yes, it would normally be multiple commits.

USAGE:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Feedback is welcome, especially about the way I handled the highlighting of the winning squares. Is there a more "react-ish" way of passing the necessary information to the individual cells?
